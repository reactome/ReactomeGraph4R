Description: Pathways, reactions, and biological entities in Reactome knowledge 
    are systematically represented as an ordered network. Instances are 
    represented as nodes and relationships between instances as edges; they are 
    all stored in the Reactome Graph Database. This package serves as an 
    interface to query the interconnected data from a local Neo4j database, 
    with the aim of minimizing the usage of Neo4j Cypher queries.
